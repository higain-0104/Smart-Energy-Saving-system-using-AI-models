📄 Project Summary: Smart Energy Control System

Overview This project focuses on predicting building energy consumption using a deep learning approach and automating the decision-making process for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems. By leveraging historical usage data, the system identifies patterns and anomalies to optimize energy efficiency.

Final Conclusion The system successfully bridges the gap between predictive modeling and real-world application, providing a scalable solution for smart building energy management.

# ⚡ Smart Energy Saving System using AI Models

This repository features an end-to-end deep learning solution designed to predict building energy consumption and provide automated control logic for HVAC systems.

## 📌 Project Overview
Energy management is critical for operational efficiency and sustainability. This project utilizes a **Sequential Neural Network** to analyze consumption patterns and offers a prescriptive approach to energy saving.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Google Colab)
- **Library:** TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas
- **Key Concept:** Deep Learning Regression, Dropout for Overfitting, Prescriptive Analytics

## 📊 Key Results & Visualizations
*We analyzed the model's reliability by comparing actual usage vs. predicted values.*

> **Model Interpretation:** The scatter plot demonstrates high predictive accuracy, with data points closely following the "Perfect Prediction" line.



## 🚀 Intelligent Decision Logic
Beyond prediction, the system provides automated feedback:
- **High Demand (>80):** "Decrease HVAC usage"
- **Low Demand (<60):** "Increase HVAC usage"
- **Optimal (60-80):** "Maintain current settings"

## 📂 How to Use
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to train the model and see the visualization results.
